# WizzSheet

This app helps you keep track of scores while playing the card game Wizard. It replaces the traditional paper score sheet, making it easier and faster to calculate points. **This app does not include the cards or the rules of the game itself.** You'll need a physical deck of Wizard cards and be familiar with the game's rules to play.

## How to Use

1. **Adjust Player Count:** Use the "+" and "-" icons to add or remove players.

2. **Enter Player Names:** Type in the name for each player.

3. **Start the Game:** Click the blue "Start" button.

4. **Enter Bids:** The first player's bid input field will be automatically focused. Enter the bid and press Tab to move to the next player's input. The app automatically manages input focus, ensuring it's always on the correct player's turn.

5. **Enter Tricks:** After all bids are entered, enter the number of tricks each player actually took, following the same Tab-based input method as with bids.

6. **Input Validation:**

- **Red Input Fields:** Indicate invalid characters or bid/trick amounts (e.g., non-numeric input, bids exceeding the remaining cards in the round).
- **Red Rows:** Indicate that the total bids for a round match the total number of tricks, which is not allowed in Wizard.

7. **Game Results:** The current scores and round information are displayed at the bottom of the screen.

8. **End Game:** To finish the game, open the menu and select "End Game," then confirm your choice.

9. **Game Configuration:** You can customize the point calculation rules by going to the menu and selecting "Game Config." This allows you to adjust the scoring system to your preferred variations.
